and executes it, returning a promise that will fail with `error` if `error`
is truthy, and realise with `value` if `error` is falsy. This is a common
Node callback idiom, so this macro can be useful for wrapping Node calls in
promises, eg.:

    (defer-node (.readFile fs \"/etc/passwd\"))

The above code will call fs.readFile() and return a promise that will realise
with the file's contents when the operation is done, or fail with an appropriate
error if the operation returns one.

Optionally, you can specify a transformer function to apply to the success value
before it's realised. `js->clj` is a likely candidate."
